# strive-apr21-M3D9
- CRUD:
  - adding a card 
  - deleting all ( not all, one is protected frontend & backend )

### i just missed a homework, and all needed to go wrong, gone wrong LOL:
- Frontend:
    - Obfs code that protect from debug attempts
    - i made a custom image uploader from scratch and interfacing it with imgBB APIs
    - fetching stuff with rest backend wrapper API
    - it's responsive, so also media queries for the element
    - HTML is clean micro templating 
    - the code is consistent and enough decoupled
    - layout: boostrap col system mastered
    - images managed as blobs but displayed with src attribute
    
  
- Backend:      
    - npm packaging for dev and prod
    - static files in public  
    - server.js as index and routes
    - credentials in .env that is in .gitignore
    - strive token swapped with a decoy one
    - XSS protection middleware
    - 3rd party API wrapped with backend routes
